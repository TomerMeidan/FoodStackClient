## About
The Client Side is responsible for providing a user interface for the system, 
allowing users to interact with the system and perform various operations such as placing orders and viewing reports.

## Set Up
To set up the Client Side, follow these steps:
* Install Java on the client machine.
* Compile and run the Client Side code on the client machine, connecting to the Server Side running on a separate machine.
* Use the provided user interface to interact with the system.
The Client Side code is written in Java and uses Swing for creating the user interface. 
It also uses sockets to connect to the Server Side.

To customize the Client Side, you can modify the Java code to change the user interface or add new features. 
However, it is recommended to follow the system requirements and design guidelines to ensure compatibility with the server-side code.
